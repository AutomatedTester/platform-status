# Collecting web platform features implementation status

Potch and I are working on a website to present Mozilla's point of view on various web platform features. Other browsers have similar websites [1] [2] [3]. This project has been in lingo for a while so, to get it out the door, we're going to focus on one information: what is Mozilla's opinion on features that have not been shipped yet. We see 4 possible answers: in development, favorable, not favorable, no opinion.

In order to get accurate data and update it regularly, we need your help. Please go to the following etherpad and insert any information that can help us:

Thanks for your help!
